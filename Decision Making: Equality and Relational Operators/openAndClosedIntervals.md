# Opened and Closed Intervals
The use of opened and closed intervals is sometimes required in decision making. The difference between the two is the inclusion or exclueion of the first and last terms in such an interval or range.

The relational operators used are:
+ < and > for closed intervals
+ <= and >= for open intervals

A combination of the two could be used to create an interval opened at one end and closed on the other and vice versa. Example (10, 30] or [10, 20).

## The Binding `&&` Symbol

The `&&` `ampersand-ampersand` symbol is what binds the two different conditional statements together into one. It is an operator for logical `AND` in c++. Therefore a statement like ` input < high && input > low` translates to " input less than high and input greater than low " 

## Other use cases
Swapping the positions of the relational operators, will change the boundary of the interval. Example instead of of (10, 30) it will become )10, 30( which means All number except those between 10 and 30.
