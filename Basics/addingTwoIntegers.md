# Adding Two Integers
Now that we know how to take input and print output lets go further to add two integers. The code is shown in `addingTwoIntegers.cpp`

The variables `integer1` and `integer2` of type `int` will hold the two numbers required and then the the result will be stored in `sum` then printed

Since all three variables required are all of type `int`, they could be declared alternatively as: `int integer1, integer2, sum;` all in one line.

## Good Programming Practice
+ Choosing meaningful variable names helps a program to be self documenting. i.e it becomes easier to underatand the program simply by reading it rather than having to read manuals or use excessive comments.

+ Avoid variable names that begin with underscores `_` and double underscores `__` because c++ compilers may use names like that for their own purposes internally. This will prevent the names you choose from being confused with the ones the compilers use.
